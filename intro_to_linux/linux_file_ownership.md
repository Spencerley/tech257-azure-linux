## Why is managing file ownership important?
Managing file ownership is crucial for several reasons in Linux:

- Security: It determines who can access, modify, or delete files and directories, preventing unauthorized access and protecting sensitive data.
- Accountability: It clarifies who is responsible for specific files and directories, aiding in troubleshooting issues and maintaining system stability.
- Collaboration: It allows controlled access and modification permissions for groups of users working on shared projects or resources.

## What is the command to view file ownership?
The ls -l command displays a long listing format, including file permissions and ownership information. Here's what each part signifies:

- ls: The basic command to list files and directories.
- -l: The flag for "long listing," providing detailed information about each entry.

## What permissions are set when a user creates a file or directory? Who does file or directory belong to?

By default, when a user creates a file or directory:

- Ownership: The user who creates it becomes the owner.
- Group: The file or directory inherits the user's primary group.
- Permissions:
  - Owner: Read (r), Write (w), and Execute (x) (rwx) permissions.
  - Group: Typically assigned Read (r) permissions only (r--).
  - Others: Usually have no permissions (---).

## Why does the owner, by default, not receive X permissions when they create a file?

Directories don't inherently require execute permission for the owner to access them. The owner already has read and write permissions, allowing navigation, file listing, and file management within the directory. Granting execute permission wouldn't provide additional functionality in this context. However, execute permission might be necessary for specific directory-related commands or scripts depending on their intended use.

## What command is used to change the owner of a file or directory?
The chown command is used to modify the owner and/or group ownership of a file or directory. However, to change ownership, you usually need to be the root user (administrator) or have administrative privileges using sudo.

Bash Example:
`sudo chown <new_owner> <file_or_directory>`
