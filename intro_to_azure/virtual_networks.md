## Virtual Networks

- Private vs Public IP addresses
    - have to pay for public IP adresses
    - Certain spaces reserved for private IP addresses
    - Public people can get to it
    - We use private on the inside of our networs so thers can’t access them which is why we need ssh and a public IP
- We are talking about IPv4 rather than the new IPv6
- There’s a lot of space here to assign.
